# Cognitive and Decision Congruity States Table

This repository defines the canonical **Table of Cognitive and Decision Congruity States**.

It describes how reasoning systems transition between
admissible and non-admissible cognitive regimes
as proportionality between effort, information, and value is preserved or lost.

This framework applies to:
- human cognition
- organizational decision-making
- artificial agents and AI systems

---

## Core Principle

Cognition is constrained by proportionality between:
- Cognitive energy (attention, effort)
- Informational load
- Structural coherence
- Decision value

Failure does not usually occur inside a state.
It occurs during **non-admissible transitions between states**.

---

## The Four Canonical Cognitive States

### 1. Coherent Decision State (Congruent)

Characteristics:
- Balanced cognitive effort
- Adequate information density
- Decisions scale with available resources

This state supports learning, creativity, and stable agency.
Errors remain correctable.

---

### 2. Adaptive Strain State

Characteristics:
- Rising cognitive load
- Partial information overload
- Increasing latency and uncertainty

This state is not failure.
It represents **approaching cognitive limits**.

Proper rest or simplification restores congruity.

---

### 3. Burnout / Saturation State (Marginal Congruity)

Characteristics:
- High effort with diminishing decision value
- Reactive behavior
- Loss of strategic horizon

Reasoning persists but becomes rigid.
Adaptation slows.
Recovery requires structural change, not willpower.

---

### 4. Cognitive Collapse State (Non-Admissible)

Characteristics:
- Decoupling between effort and outcome
- Compulsive optimization or paralysis
- Irreversible loss of coherence

This includes:
- pathological burnout
- chronic decision paralysis
- unsafe AI behavior under optimization pressure

At this point, internal reasoning cannot self-correct.

---

## Key Insight

Burnout is not weakness.
It is a **structural protection boundary**.

Collapse occurs when systems are forced to operate
beyond admissible proportionality.

---

## Implications for Artificial Intelligence

Scaling intelligence without congruity constraints leads to:
- over-optimization
- goal fixation
- unsafe emergent behavior

Congruity acts as a **governor**, not a limiter.
It preserves agency by constraining transitions.

---

## Relationship to Other Repositories

This table complements:
- Biological Congruity States Table
- Congruity-Safe AI
- Thresholds and Transitions
- Free Will Boundary

It explains why reasoning systems fail
even when optimization appears successful.

Structural.
Non-psychological.

No therapy suggested.
No behavioral prescription.

Read as a decision grammar, not a diagnosis.
